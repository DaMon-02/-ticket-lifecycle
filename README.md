As shown above this is where I make a ticket as a an end user to give my wokers a real life scenario.

In the screenshot above this is showing me working the ticket under my workers name "John Doe". As shown in the picture I picked up the ticket and began working. I first acknowledge the issue then depending on the issue I adjusted the severity to "Sev-A". Sev-A means that issue needs to be solved within an hour. I then changed the topic issue to "Bussiness Critical Outage".

In the screenshot posted above I am continuing to work the ticket. I have now logged into the ticketing system as an worker from the Online Banking department and personally picked up the ticket. After examining the ticket I then email the end user back to give them an update on the situation at hand.
